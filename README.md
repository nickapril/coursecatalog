# README

This application can be used to view the courses, instructors and subjects at a given university. The user can create an account and enroll in courses.

Some problems I had:
- Two success flash messages appear with a successfull enrollment. See comment in enrollments_controller
- Could not scaffold a table called Courses becuase it was either already used in my application or it is a prohibited word. I named this table Lessons instead.
